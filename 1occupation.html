DarkShot is a free application built for you to live in the moment and capture your unforgettable memories. When you start recording, the screen will become black. This effect, by design, will force you to witness the event you're capturing not through your screen, but rather, through reality without a device obstructing your view. DarkShot is also great because it doesn't create illmuation to disturb people around you. DarkShot allows you to be in the moment and capture the moments you don't want to forget.
